# MvcWithNG
My first attempt of self learning. A C#.Net app with MVC4 Web Api, SQL Server 2008, Angular JS
To start learning what is not being taught, I thought to create an application from step 0 and build it step by step.
The name denotes MVC from C# and NG denotes the AngularJS role.

This would enlighten me with knowledge of what and how to create an application from scratch, some wrongs which would make me learn my mistakes and correct them.

This application has 2 parts. One part contains some tutorials on Angular JS basics which I found somewhere and help me learn some basic.
Second part is the actual application where I tried to create a basic CRUD application which would list some saved bookmarks, add/update/delete the list.

## Why I choose Bookmarks?

While my browsing and learning phase, I came across many links which I liked and wanted to save them but I dont use to visit them regularly. So I thought to have a applicaiton on my local machine where I can do all such things without any restriction.
This also helped me about build and deploy process.

This app may not be working right now but contains my first ever created, fully functional application.
Technologies: AngularJS, C#, Web Apis, SQL Server 2008.
Tools: Visual Studio.
